## Quick Tips

2. **Ski/Bike Shops** - Good conversion potential
3. **Ski Clubs** - Lower individual value but high volume potential

### 📧 **Email Best Practices**
- Send emails in morning (9-11 AM) for best open rates
- Personalize every email - use actual names and businesses
- Keep initial emails short (under 150 words)
- Always include clear call-to-action
- Use promo code **2104** in all communications

### 📞 **Phone Call Strategy**
- Call between 10 AM - 4 PM, avoid Mondays and Fridays
- Have contact details open before calling
- Use the phone script but make it conversational
- Always offer to send follow-up email with details

### 📊 **Tracking**
- Log activity IMMEDIATELY after each interaction
- Set follow-up dates for everything (default: 3-5 days)
