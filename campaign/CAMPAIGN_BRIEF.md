# 🎯 Campaign Brief - AdSell.ai Ski Industry Outreach

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Understanding the Business Model

**AdSell.ai is a PLATFORM/MARKETPLACE** - NOT a publisher or magazine company.

### What AdSell.ai Actually Does

**AdSell.ai connects advertisers with print publications** (newspapers and magazines). It's like:
- Airbnb for print advertising (connects two sides of a market)
- An advertising platform/marketplace
- A self-service tool that cuts out traditional ad agencies

### Who Your Contacts Are

**These ski vendors are POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS who would:**
- Use AdSell.ai to advertise THEIR OWN businesses
- Place ads for their ski resorts, shops, or clubs
- Reach customers through existing newspapers and magazines
- Pay for advertising through the AdSell.ai platform

### What You're Selling

You're selling ACCESS to the AdSell.ai platform so these businesses can:

✅ **Place print ads themselves** (no agency needed)
✅ **Reach hundreds of publications** (newspapers, magazines, outdoor publications)
✅ **Save 50-70% on costs** (by cutting out agency fees)
✅ **Target the right publications** (AI helps them find where their customers read)
✅ **Track ROI** (even for print advertising)

### Core Benefits (Always Include)
1. **Direct Access** - No agency fees, better rates

### Objection Handling

**"We don't have budget"**
→ "That's why this is perfect - you're cutting out the agency fees. You could start with a few hundred dollars and still reach thousands of people."

**"Print doesn't work"**
→ "You're reaching a completely different audience than digital - families planning trips, older skiers, people reading local weekend guides. Our ski business customers see 15-30x ROI regularly."

**"We only do digital"**
→ "That makes sense! Most businesses do both. Digital is great for immediate response, but print builds awareness with audiences you're missing - especially people actually planning ski trips."

**"Too complicated"**
→ "It's actually easier than setting up a Facebook ad. Upload your design, pick publications, submit. Our AI even tells you which publications will work best."
